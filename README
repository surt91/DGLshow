A simple ode solver (Runge Kutta 4) with a simple Qt based 
visualization.

A very rudimentary GUI and a few sample ode (from simple mechanics) are 
included.

To edit the initial values (like mass, position, velocity, ...) the 
source has to be edited -- currently.

To compile Qt4 or Qt5 is needed.
Linux is tested, other OS are not.
Compile with:
qmake; make

Have fun watching the colorful pixels ;)
